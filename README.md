# Organize-JPG-RAW
This will organise JPGs and (only currently) CR2s into separate folders and monitor.
This is especially useful if your camera saves images as RAW and JPG at the same time.

Normally you'd have to go through the JPGs and delete bad ones, then delete the RAWs manually, this will
monitor two folders and "deleted" the RAW files if a JPG has been deleted by moving it to a folder called "deleted". 

## Usage
* Have a folder with RAWs and JPGs
* Run the script
* Images are moved into the CR2/JPG sub folders
* Script starts monitoring the JPG folder for deletions.


## Notes
* Eventually in app importing from SD card will be added.
